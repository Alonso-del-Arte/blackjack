# Blackjack variants

There are a lot of variants of blackjack, even if we ignore individual casino 
variations regarding what pairs may be split, how many decks are used and what 
the payouts are.

The game that I'm focusing on in this project is sometimes called "American 
blackjack."

## Atlantic City blackjack

This variant, which first emerged in Atlantic City casinos, allows late 
surrender (you can give up half the bet of a bad hand). Also, you can split 
pairs thrice. Payout for natural blackjack is 6 to 5, rather than 3 to 2, 
depending on the casino.

## Blackjack switch

Each player gets two hands, each with the same wager. But the thing that sets 
this game apart from other blackjack games is that a player can switch cards 
between hands.

To compensate for this player advantage, the dealer doesn't bust on 22.

## European blackjack

This variant originated in European casinos. The dealer at first only has a face 
up card, and it is only right before settling bets that the dealer takes a 
second card.

## Perfect pairs

If a player's first two cards are of the same value or they're both royal cards, 
that player wins a side bet.

## Spanish 21

Standard decks are used but with the Tens removed. This makes blackjack harder 
to get, but when you do get blackjack, you win even if the dealer also has 
blackjack.

Note that Spanish 21 is a registered trademark of Masque Publishing since 2001, 
renewed in 2020. I don't have a Spanish 21 license. While I don't discourage you 
from using my software package to play Spanish 21, I don't encourage that 
either.

## Vegas Strip blackjack

Not quite understanding how this one differs from standard blackjack...

### Central Las Vegas Strip blackjack

Nor am I sure how this one differs from "regular" Vegas Strip blackjack...
