# Blackjack variants

There are a lot of variants of blackjack, even if we ignore individual casino 
variations regarding what pairs may be split, how many decks are used and what 
the payouts are.

## Atlantic City blackjack

This variant, which first emerged in Atlantic City casinos, allows late 
surrender (you can give up half the bet of a bad hand). Also, you can split 
pairs thrice. Payout for natural blackjack is 6 to 5, rather than 3 to 2, 
depending on the casino.

## European blackjack

This variant originated in European casinos. The dealer at first only has a face 
up card, and it is only right before settling bets that the dealer takes a 
second card.

## Spanish 21

Standard decks are used but with the Tens removed. This makes blackjack harder 
to get, but when you do get blackjack, you win even if the dealer also has 
blackjack.

## Vegas Strip blackjack

Not quite understanding how this one differs from standard blackjack...
